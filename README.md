![Overview](overview.png)

Students at the University of Washington have very few resources to learn about what the classes they could sign up for are like. The University of Washington does provide a course evaluation catalog that summarizes student evaluations of courses. However, the catalog is difficult to use, with users having to rely on their browser's find functionality to search for courses. Additionally, the catalog only lists data from the previous two quarters, making it difficult to observe trends over time. In order to make this data easier to view and understand, we built CourseRatings, an online tool that provides displays evaluations of courses at the University of Washington. Built using React, D3, jQuery, Python, and TaffyDB, CourseRatings allows users to search for, sort through, visualize and compare courses they're interested in. CourseRatings has two goals - to give students and instructors access to the data they need to make informed choices about the classes they take or teach, as well as to present this data in an intuitive and user-friendly way.
