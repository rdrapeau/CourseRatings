## Running Instructions

Put your running instructions here.  (Tell us how to open your visualization.)

If your visualization is web-based,  it would be great if your submissions can be opened online. [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/) is a good and easy way to put your visualization online so you can put your link here.  For example:

Access our visualization at http://cse512-15s.github.io/fp-jheer-domoritz-jsnydes/ or download this repository and run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9000` and access this from http://localhost:9000/.

(If you put your work online, please also write a [one-line description and add a link to your final work](http://note.io/1n3u46s) so people can access it directly from CSE512-15S page.)
